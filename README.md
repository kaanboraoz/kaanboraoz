### 👋 Hi, I'm Kaan

I'm a software developer who enjoys working on Linux and spending most of my time in the terminal. Rust and compiler internals are my main interests — I love exploring interpreters and low-level concepts in my free time.

### 🔥 What I Enjoy

- 🦀 **Rust** — My primary language, especially for exploring compiler-related ideas.
- 🐘 **PHP & Laravel** — My daily tech stack for building production applications.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 💭 Currently

- Learning and experimenting with compiler design  
- Building web applications with Laravel  
- Exploring Rust through small compiler and interpreter projects  

### 📫 Contact

You can try to reach me — though I'm usually somewhere inside a terminal 😄
